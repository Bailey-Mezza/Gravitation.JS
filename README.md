# Gravitation.js
Gravitation.js is a lightweight 2D physics engine and renderer built with vanilla JavaScript. It simulates gravity between celestial bodies, tracks positions and velocities, and can handle collisions with ease. The engine is modular — you can use it on its own or pair it with the included HTML5 canvas renderer for smooth visualizations. With a simple interface (const engine = new Engine(suns, planets)), it’s easy to get started whether you’re a student, teacher, developer, or hobbyist. From classroom simulations to interactive demos and simple games, Gravitation.js makes physics both accessible and engaging.
